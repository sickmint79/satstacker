# SatStacker — Bitcoin Wealth Planner

An open-source Bitcoin wealth planning tool for long-term stackers. Model DCA strategies, stress-test retirement scenarios, and run Monte Carlo simulations — all in your browser with no account required.

## Features

- **DCA Simulator** — Model weekly/monthly Bitcoin purchases across bear, base, and bull appreciation scenarios. See portfolio value and BTC accumulation over time with interactive charts.
- **Retirement Planner** — Input desired spending, retirement age, and inflation assumptions. Get the required portfolio size, BTC needed, and a suggested weekly DCA to hit your goal.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation** — Run 100–1,000 randomized log-normal return simulations. Visualize the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile outcome bands.
- **BTC / sats / USD toggle** — Display all values in your preferred denomination.
- **Scenario saving** — Save named scenarios to localStorage and reload them anytime.
- **URL sharing** — Share DCA scenarios via URL parameters.
- **PNG export** — Export results as an image.
- **Educational content** — Expandable explainers on DCA, volatility, scenario modeling, and risk.

## Calculation Notes

### DCA Model
Contributions are made monthly (weekly × 52/12 + monthly). Bitcoin price compounds at the assumed APR. CAGR is computed as `(finalValue / totalInvested)^(1/years) - 1`.

### Retirement Model
Uses a **3.5% safe withdrawal rate** — more conservative than the traditional 4% rule to account for Bitcoin's volatility. Required portfolio = inflation-adjusted spending ÷ 0.035. Suggested DCA is found via binary search against the base-case DCA projection.

### Monte Carlo Model
Log-normal annual returns: `return = exp(μ + σ × N(0,1)) - 1` where `μ = ln(1 + mean) - σ²/2`. This corrects for Jensen's inequality, ensuring the expected arithmetic return matches your input.
